## Quick Validation

| Phase | Key Question |
|-------|-------------|
| Constitution | "Are standards enforceable?" |
| Specification | "Can we test this?" |
| Clarification | "Anything still ambiguous?" |
| Plan | "Does this make sense?" |
| Tasks | "Doable in 30 minutes?" |
| Implementation | "Meets spec exactly?" |
